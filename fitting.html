	<h2 id="bigger">Fit for the Horse</h2>
<p>Determining saddle fit is important to the comfort and safety of horse and rider. There are many things that affect
the fit of the saddle. Here we outline the major points and how to avoid the common mistakes of saddle fitting. Use
the check boxes to note items that apply to you.
Fit for the Horse
The average, defined wither will usually fit a Medium/Regular
tree. This horse will have a more refined body with definition in
the withers-the modern version of Quarter Horses, Tennessee
Walking Horses, Thoroughbreds, etc.
The goal in saddle fitting is to have the greatest amount of contact
between the bar of the tree and the horse. Keep in mind there is no
standardization in the industry for tree sizing-measurements differ
between tree makers, saddle makers, and saddle styles.</p>

<h2 id="bigger">Withers</h2>

A more rounded, mutton wither with a flatter back will usually
fit a Wide tree. This horse has a blocky build, heavier neck,
often referred to as the “foundation” type.

Draft horses and Draft horse crosses with a very wide, flat back
and wither, will usually require a Draft or Extra Wide tree.

A very prominent, narrow wither may indicate the lack of
muscle behind the shoulder blade, and the need for a shoulder
bridge pad. The shoulder bridge pad fills in this “hollow” area,
allowing the saddle bars to make better contact with the horse.

Large muscles behind the scapula can interfere with saddle fit.
A wider tree may be needed. Flex trees also work well with this
conformation.

A level topline, wither and croup being about the same height,
is ideal.

<h2 id="bigger">Topline</h2>

Higher haunches, or the horse built “downhill”, can allow the
saddle to put more pressure on the withers and may require a
pad that is built up in the wither area.

A swayback causes “bridging” of the saddle. The bars only make
contact in the front and rear of the saddle, putting excess pressure
or rubbing the withers and loins. It can be seen in older horses,
and poorly conditioned horses, and is a common saddle fitting
problem. It can be remedied with the use of a bridge pad.

A very straight back, often seen in mules but not very prevalent
in horses, can cause the saddle to "rock". Rocking is a condition
where the tree puts more pressure on the center of the horses
back, and less at the ends of the bars. A tree with a “mule bar”
or a pad with shims may be recommended.

Consider the body condition of the horse you are fitting. A
significant amount of weight gain or loss can alter the way the
saddle fits.

<h2 id="bigger">Condition and Age</h2>
Also consider the age and maturity of the horse. A saddle you
buy for your two-year old today may not fit as well when he fills out in another year or two. As a mature horse
progresses into its senior years, changes in conformation can alter the fit of your existing saddle.</p>
